<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Welcome!  I'm Dave and I'm thrilled to have you here on my very first web page!  
  I'm passionate about software engineering and learning anything really in the tech
industry.  I look forward to learning more and hopefully you'll see that growth on my
pages in the days to come!</p>

<p>I've walked a few career paths, be it serving in the United States Army,
  leading my own business as a personal trainer and fitness consultant, and serving
  as an engineering technician for the United States Navy.  My approach to serve you best
  is rooted in a combination of expertise, creativity, commitment to my team and others,
  and most importantly, committing to the unique needs of my client.  I believe in 
  strong relationships based on trust and collaboration to ensure an amazing final product.

<p>When I'm not immersed in work, you can find me doing some type of weight training,
  leading group exercise or studying something new!  I'm a solid believer in lifelong learning,   
while seeking new opportunities to grow and promote growth with those around me.  Thank you for visiting,
and I look forward to growing more with you soon!  </p>
